# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Analysis

This project analyzed PyBer Ride data to obtain insights on how different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural) affect volume of rides, driver count, and the fares charged.  

The first part of the analysis showed the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. In addition, this data was then used to calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type.  The data analyzed is from January 1,2019 through May 8, 2019.

The second part of the analysis produced a multiple-line chart of total fares on a weekly basis for each city type.  The data analyzed is from January 1, 2019 through April 28, 2019.


## Results
The results from the first part of the analysis are shown in the table below:

This data indicates that there are, as expected, much more drivers and rides given in highly populated urban areas and declines as the population density decreases through suburban and rural areas.

Breaking the data down further:
- Total Rides: The number of urban rides is 2.6 times higher compared to suburban areas and 13 times higher compared to rural areas
- Total Drivers: The number of urban drivers is almost 5 times higher compared to suburban areas and almost 31 times higher compared to rural areas
- Total Fares: Given the much larger volume of rides, the total fares over this time period for urban areas is roughly 2 times higher compared to suburban areas and roughly 9 times higher compared to rural areas
- Average Fare per Rider and Average Fare per Driver:
	- The average fares are where normalizing the data into an average per ride/driver really tells the story of how the population density affects the pricing of rides
		- Average Fare per Ride: Suburban average fare per ride is 26% higher compared to urban, and rural average fare per ride is 41% higher compared to urban cities
		- Average Fare per Driver: Suburban average fare per driver is almost 140% higher compared to urban, and rural is roughly 235% higher compared to urban cities
		
The results form the second part of the analysis are shown in the following chart:
![Pyber Total Fare by City Type](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
This chart visually shows the consistently higher volume of dollars generated on a weekly basis for each city type.  Based on population density, urban settings consistently bring in a larger dollar amount on a weekly basis compared to the less dense suburban and rural settings.

## Summary
This analysis clearly shows the affect that population density has on PyBer's ridesharing services.  The higher the density, the more total money is brought in and the more drivers there are to service customers.

Based on the results, three business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types are:
1. All city types are important as they all generate revenue, however, the volume of rides, and therefore the total amount of revenue that can be generated in a higher population density area such as urban areas, are where the main focus should be to maximize revenue potential.
2. There could be a potential untapped marketshare in the less populated areas.  Although urban areas are the main source of revenue currently, people might not think to use PyBer's service in suburban and rural areas because they are more comfortable driving their own car or are unaware of what PyBer can offer.  Targeted marketing campaigns in these city types could be beneficial to raise revenue if a larger population were inclined to us PyBer instead of driving their own vehicle.
3. Similar to the last point, a potential reason more people don't utilize PyBer to get around in suburban and rural areas is its too expensive and/or it takes too long to get a ride - both of these items could be due to there not being enough drivers to service future customers and bring the wait time and fare per ride down.  Targeted marketing to potential drivers explaining they have the potential to earn higher fares compared to a driver in urban settings could be implemented to put more drivers on the road. This would bring the fares down a bit, but could have a larger impact on the time it takes for a customer to get a ride which could generate more revenue overall due to the larger volume of rides given.
